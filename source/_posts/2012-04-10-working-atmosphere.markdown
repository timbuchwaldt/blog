When it comes to creative work, I found out that I work best when the environment is inspiring and giving you the freedom you need. It might be the right wallpaper that gives you the kick you need (my [collection](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6hs0biviajmvpha/4tEJvGFUdW), all attributions go to [Interfacelift](http://interfacelift.com/)). I decided to switch them every 5 minutes, so they always feel fresh. To accompany the wallpapers I chose [Instaview](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/instaview-view-instagram-photostreams/id431353913?mt=12) (MAS), to display 2 frames of Instagram images (Images taken near me & the Instagram top images). To unclutter my desktop,  I created a "Junk" folder with a custom icon. ([Icons](http://www.iconarchive.com/show/alumin-folders-icons-by-wilnichols.html) & [Manual](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2493)).

Finished result:
