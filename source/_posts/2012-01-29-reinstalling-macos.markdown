Once in a while you reach the point where your system just doesn't work right anymore. I reached that point some months ago, but didn't have the time to reinstall everything and set it up again. 
This weekend i finally had some spare hours, so i cloned my internal SSD via Carbon Copy Cloner to a sparseimage and formatted it afterwards.
After reinstalling Mac OS X Lion from scratch and some setup-work (xCode, Mail-Accounts, homebrew, oh-my-zsh and so on) i have a fast OS that performs like hell and doesn't have any of those strange bugs it had before (e.g. not being able to install Ruby 1.9.2 via rvm.).
